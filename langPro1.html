<h2>Text Editor: Q1</h2>
<p>I chose the nano text editor. I am a little bit familiar with it and I hate vim for some reason. Also, I like the little menu below that reminds you of the (ctrl)+(...) options</p>
<a href = "http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor">Nano Tutorial</a>
<p>The tutorial covered how to install nano and open a file, shortcuts, navagation, copy pasting, and some basic history of the editor.</p>

<h2>Version Control: Q2</h2>
<p>I did a github tutorial because I am somewhat familiar with it but felt 
like I was not using it to its full potential. The tutorial went over all
the basics of using git, but what I learned was the function of branches. 
Believe it or not, I always just commited to master for all changes, rather
than using branches to work on several versions of the same repository.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts: Q3</h2>
<h4>What is the next concept that you would like to learn about your text editor?</h4>
<p>I would like to learn why it is so hard to undo an action. Learning how
to use it, I have made several mistakes and not been able to figure out how to
undo an action</p>
<h4>What about your VCS?</h4>
<p>I would like to get some experience as not the main anministrator on a 
project, I only know what it looks like from the top as a contributor.</p>
<h4>How many commits did you make while working on this project?</h4>
<p>Just one after I was done...This isn't a large project I guess. I saved it 
several times on my machine though.</p>
<h4>How would you structure your commits differently next time.</h4>
<p>I would definatly use branches. I am not sure I understand them completly, but I think they are the whole point of VC.</p>
